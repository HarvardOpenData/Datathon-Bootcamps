# R Bootcamp

## What is R?

As a powerful, free language built by statisticians for statisticians, R is an important tool for data scientists and statisticians like us. R is also extremely useful for other tasks like web development through the use of packages. See https://syllabusexplorer.harvard.edu/, https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html or https://sbilliau.shinyapps.io/Genetics/ for examples of websites and apps built with R.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to write code, make graphics, access files, etc. 

## Your First R Script

The S2019 Stat 111 RBootcamp is in the other resources folder. It was created by great TFS in that class (Sundar Solai, Shaoyang Ning, Everett Sussman). It's a great resource as well.
