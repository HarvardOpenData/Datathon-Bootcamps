# R Bootcamp

## What is R?

As a powerful, free language built by statisticians for statisticians, R is an important tool for data scientists and statisticians like us. R is also extremely useful for other tasks like web development through the use of packages. See https://syllabusexplorer.harvard.edu/ or https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html for examples of websites and apps built with R Shiny.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to write code, make graphics, access files, etc. 

## Your First R Script
First, clone or download this repository. Using RStudio, open the Rbootcamp.R file and follow along. 

## Acknowledgements & Other Resources
Solutions are in the other resources folder. 

The more advanced Stat 111 RBootcamp is in the other resources folder. It was created by great TFS in that class (Sundar Solai, Shaoyang Ning, Everett Sussman). It's a great resource if you want to learn ggplot2 â€“ something we won't really teach in this course, but you're welcome to learn to improve your graphics. We encourage you to use ggplot in your final projects. 

Vincent Viego, my Math 23c partner last year deserves credit for his contributions to our final project.
